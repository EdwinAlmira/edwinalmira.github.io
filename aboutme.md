My name is Edwin Almira, a newbie in this DevOps world who try to learn and adopt this culture.

### My story

I start as a backend developer in 2017, working with OOP languages (Java, Ruby, C#), web frameworks and SQL databases. The problem here is that most of the projects I contributed were monolithic with waterfall methodology and a lot of culture problems. I was a kind of firefighter in several projects already done or about to be finished.

Right now (and I hope for a long time) I'm working as DevOps Engineer in a entry role for a company at El Salvador, so I create this blog to share my learning and discovery process and hopefully help you with the content in this blog.
